In this directory, you'll find two main folders: one dedicated to my machine learning projects and another focused on machine learning concepts.

* Machine Learning Projects
* Machine Learning Concepts

Within the ML projects folder, you'll discover various projects ranging from simple to complex, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.

Meanwhile, the ML concepts folder is designed to provide a clear understanding of individual machine learning concepts. Each concept is explained in a simplified manner, 
allowing for easy comprehension and application if you're looking to learn a specific concept.
